* For each streak, a "streak card" is rendered with the following data: streak type, duration and start time
* For streaks that have an associated photo, display the photo on the streak card
* For streaks that have an associated location, display a map frame of the location on the streak card
* For streaks that have both an associated location and photo, only display the photo on the streak card
* If there aren't streaks for a certain day, display a "No Streaks for Today" line item
